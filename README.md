# WordPress Test


## Overview

The aim of this test is to get a simple WordPress site up and running and add a simple 
listing template to it. This will help demonstrate your understanding of WordPress' data
structure, templating as well as a little CSS and JS.


## Getting Started

Start by taking a local copy of this repo's contents. Either by cloning it or downloading the zip.

Then setup a local server environment through whichever method you're comfortable. It should run at least PHP7
as well as MySQL. Setup local domain name for the site like `westoak.test` and set the public folder for
it to the `site` directory which is in the base of this repo.
